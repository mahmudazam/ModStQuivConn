\section{Introduction}

We will work with fppf/\'etale/? stacks
(which includes schemes, algebraic spaces, algebraic stacks,
formal algebraic spaces, formal algebraic stacks)
over a base field $k$, of characteristic $0$, if needed.
We wish to prove the algebraicity of a stack whose $k$--points are morphisms of
connections. By \cites{NonAbHodgeFilt, GeomNonAbHodgeFilt, ModQuivBun},
this stack should be the pullback:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\mc{M}_{\Vect(X_{DR}), 1}
  \ar[r] \ar[d] \ar[rd, "\lrcorner" very near start, phantom] &
\Map(X_{DR}, \mc{E}_{X_\Lambda}^\vee \boxtimes \mc{E}_{X_\Lambda})) \ar[d] \\
\mathrm{pt} \ar[r, "\overline{\Delta}"] &
\Map(X_{DR}, X_{DR} \times X_{DR})
\end{tikzcd}\]
To prove the algebraicity of the pullback, it suffices to show that the
right and bottom left vertices are algebraic, and that the bottom right
vertex has a diagonal representable by algebraic spaces
\cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/04TF}{Lemma 04TF}]{stacks-project}.

We note that $X_{DR}$ is an example of a formal groupoid defined in
\cite[23]{AlgGeom-n-St}, and we will try to show the result for
an arbitrary formal groupoid $X_\Lambda$. By varying ``$\Lambda$'' in a sense
that we can make precise, this simultaneously
shows the algebraicity of the moduli stacks of morphisms of Higgs bundles,
morphisms of $\lambda$--connections for each $\lambda \in k$, and the moduli stack
fibred over $\bb{A}^1_k$ and parametrizing morphisms of all $\lambda$--connections
for all $\lambda \in k$. The last example gives us a way to address non-Abelian
Hodge theory from the stack theoretic perspective ---
namely, the ``preferred sections'' approach of Deligne and Simpson
\cites{NonAbHodgeFilt,GeomNonAbHodgeFilt}.

\section{Strategy (algebraicity of
{$\Map(X_\Lambda, \mc{E}_{X_\Lambda}^\vee \boxtimes \mc{E}_{X_\Lambda})$}): Show that
the target is very presentable \cite[69]{Prsntbl-n-St}}

The goal is to apply something like \cite[Lemma 4.23]{Prsntbl-n-St} and
\cite[Theorem 7.2]{AlgGeom-n-St}.

\section{Strategy (algebraicity of
{$\Map(X_\Lambda, \mc{E}_{X_\Lambda}^\vee \boxtimes \mc{E}_{X_\Lambda})$)}:
Verify Artin's axioms}

\section{Strategy (representability of the diagonal of {$X_\Lambda$}):
First show that ($X_\Lambda$) has a representable diagonal}

Adapt \cite[Theorem 3.4.13]{AlperModuli} to prove that quotients of
smooth formal groupoids, as defined in say \cite[23]{AlgGeom-n-St},
are formal algebraic stacks, as defined in \cite[Definition 5.3.]{FormalAlgSt}.
Then, \cite[Lemma 5.12]{FormalAlgSt} shows that $X_\Lambda$ has a diagonal
representable by algebraic spaces and locally of finite type. Use this
show the representability of the diagonal of
$\Map(X_\Lambda, X_\Lambda \times X_\Lambda)$.

\section{Strategy (Direct): Representable map of section stacks}

Consider the pullback squares:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\mc{F}
  \ar[r] \ar[d]
  \ar[rd, "\lrcorner" very near start, phantom] &
\mc{E}_{X_\Lambda}^\vee \boxtimes \mc{E}_{X_\Lambda}
  \ar[d] \\
X_\Lambda'
  \ar[r] \ar[d] \ar[rd, "\lrcorner" very near start, phantom] &
(\mc{M}_{\Perf(X_\Lambda)} \times X_\Lambda)^2
  \ar[d] \\
X_\Lambda \ar[r, "\Delta_{X_\Lambda}" below] &
X_\Lambda \times X_\Lambda
\end{tikzcd}\]

Then, we have
\[
\mc{M}_{\Perf(X_\Lambda), 1} = \Gamma(X_\Lambda, \mc{F})
\]
Find a map:
\[
\Gamma(X_\Lambda, \mc{F}) \to \Gamma(X_\Lambda', \mc{F})
\text{ or } \Gamma(X_\Lambda', \mc{F}) \to \Gamma(X_\Lambda, \mc{F})
\]
given by composing with the pullback projection $X_\Lambda' \to X_\Lambda$,
using the universal property of pullbacks. The stack $\Gamma(X_\Lambda', \mc{F})$
is geometric $n$-stack by \cite[Corollary 6.4]{AlgGeom-n-St}. If we can show that the
first above morphism is geometric, then
$\mc{M}_{\Perf(X_\Lambda), 1} = \Gamma(X_\Lambda, \mc{F})$ should be geometric
by \cite[Corollary 2.6]{AlgGeom-n-St}. If we can show that the second above morphism
is geometric, surjective and smooth, then $\mc{M}_{\Perf(X_\Lambda), 1} = \Gamma(X_\Lambda, \mc{F})$
is geometric by \cite[Lemma 2.4]{AlgGeom-n-St}.
